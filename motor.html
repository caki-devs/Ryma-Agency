                        <p>Excess is the uninsured portion of the loss that you have to bear in an insurance claim. Excess is
                            a percentage of the sum insured and is paid to the insurer for any repair in case of accidental
                            damages. In case where the vehicle is stolen or a write off / total loss, the excess shall be
                            paid before the final claim payment to you. However, the policy may specify to a minimum of excess
                            amount which is insurable.
                            <strong>Note:</strong> Excess can be insured so that in the event of the loss you don’t have to pay anything.
                            In many insurances you have to part with 0.25% 0n motor private and 0.5% on commercial vehicles.

                        <p>Most Kenyans are not aware that Political violence and terrorism is not covered on all general insurance
                            policies, it is an extensions that can either be added to most of the common general insurance
                            policies or taken as a standalone. It is therefore advisable to take this option to protect your
                            asset from any politically instigated damage. A common occurrence of these is strikes, protests
                            and riots, which arise out of political dissatisfactions and lead to destruction of public properties.
                            For terrorism, cases like the Westgate where properties and vehicles were destroyed. The cost
                            of this cover is normally charged at 0.25% of the value of the insured vehicle.

                        <p>Car insurance does not cover liabilities to owner and his/ her family members, therefore in the event
                            of a car accident, any medical expenses or liabilities by owner or members of the family travelling
                            in the accident vehicle are not covered. It is therefore crucial to consider a personal accident
                            cover for the owner and his family. Personal accident covers are among the lowly charged insurance
                            covers so they are affordable.</p>

                            an alternative car to use while the accident vehicle is in the garaged. Most insurance companies
                            therefore provide an option of a replacement courtesy car for a maximum of 10 days while the
                            insured motor vehicle is out of use. They can provide an actual car or offer re-imbursement of
                            Ksh 3,000 for each day that the insured vehicle is out of use up to a total maximum of Ksh 30,000
                            <strong>Note:</strong> There is a waiting period of the first 3 days, meaning the insured will not be
